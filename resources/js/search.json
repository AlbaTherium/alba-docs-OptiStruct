[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Thank you for choosing OptiStruct","OptiStruct is an indicator for the Tradingview charting platform that is designed to automate the setup and maintenance tasks for traders who are utilising the Trading Hub 3.0 strategy taught by Mr Khan at https://www.youtube.com/@TRADiNGhub","The Trading Hub 3.0 methodology requires advanced knowledge and time from the trader. We have used our expert knowledge of the strategy to create automations in order to free up your time, enabling you to be more productive. Whether you choose to use the time to monitor more instruments with a view to increase your revenue potential or be more productive in other areas of life is entirely up to you! OptiStruct enables you to set up alerts for the instruments, setups and time frames that you would like to monitor without watching Tradingview. You can set and forget until you receive an alert.","OptiStruct is part of a suite of indicators that cover the concepts in the strategy. Please check out our other products at https://albatherium.com/"]},{"l":"OptiStruct Features","p":["Alert on confirmed highs / lows sweep","Alert on decisional POI mitigation","Alert on extreme POIs mitigation","Alert on historical zone mitigation","Alert on new confirmed BoS / CHoCH","Alert on new fake BoS / CHoCH","Alert on pre-IDM supply / demand zones","Alert when an inducement is taken","All of the features above are highly configurable enabling you to create an experience that suits you. Colours, labels, line types, line widths and much more can be tailored to fit your needs. Many of our customers have customised their experience to mimic that of their own manual mapping to enjoy a familiar experience.","Display historical unmitigated order blocks","Fire alerts when SMT zones are mitigated","Fully automated structure mapping","Highlight on confirmed highs / lows sweep","Mark confirmed BoS / CHoCH levels","Mark confirmed highs and lows","Mark decisional POIs","Mark extreme POIs","Mark live inducements","Mark new inducements as they are printed","Mark pre-IDM supply / demand zones","Mark SMT (Smart Money Trap) zones","The structure mapping concept is the foundation layer of the Trading Hub strategy and is what sets it apart from other strategies. Having said that - it is an advanced topic and is the most challenging concept to understand and apply. It is likely the most common reason for the traders who fail to make the strategy work for them. OptiStruct applies Trading Hub 3.0 structure mapping to any instrument on any time frame, straight out of the box."]}],[{"l":"Getting Started","p":["The very first thing you must do, if you haven't already is join our Discord at https://discord.gg/albatherium"]},{"l":"Grab your license","p":["Visit https://albatherium.com/ and grab your copy of OptiStruct.
